## Plan on improving the project

The layout design of the webpage definitely have much more room for improvement. It is at the stage where you can scroll and see all the content. I believe in simplicity so the viewer can navigate through the website easily. For example. The main page should consist of a company's name and logo along with a small description of the history of company. Next, there should be a navigation bar that allows the viewer can navigate through each website independently such as menu, recipes, reservation, and about section. I believe adding in a a chat interface would be nice for people who have questions as well and it can be using automated AI for responses.
